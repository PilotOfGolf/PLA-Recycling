TL/DR: A repo containing all of the files for a DIY PLA recycling machine.

  Hello! If you are here, you probably already know what this project is about, but if not I will provide a brief run down of what it is. 

  There is a problem with FDM manufacturing. This problem is: too much scrap material is being wasted. Sources of this include failed prints, filament change, and draft prints. All of these are simply required when printing. There is no way to get the consumer to stop doing these things. This wasted material is bad both because it wastes money (it does add up), and pollutes the earth. Neither of those are good things obviously. 
  
  Solution A: Pay $22,000 and get an industrial setup. This is not viable for a consumer however because it's just too much. There has to be another solution, right? 
  
  Solution B: Create an open source PLA recycling machine. This is better, because well... open source. 

  This won't be an easy endevour though. I will need as much help as I can get. So, join the discord server! https://discord.gg/wU8wEXCHkt
